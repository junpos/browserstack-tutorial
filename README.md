### Requirement

- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) is a NodeJS package manager. As its name would imply, you can use it to install node programs. Installation document is [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
- [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) and [Chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) for setting up the actual tests and making assertions.
- [WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) is a standard API browsers expose to enable remote controlâ€”e.g. an API to say things like "load this page, then find this element, then click on it, then wait, then find this element, then read the contents."
- [Selenium Webdriver Node API](http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/javascript/index.html), a Promise-oriented Selenium client (we install it via [browserstack-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserstack-webdriver)).
